# SECOND YEAR PAPER - III
## Computer Networking Syllabus

### 1. Introduction to Networking
   - **Definition of a Network**:
     - A network is a collection of devices (computers, printers, servers, etc.) that are connected to communicate and share resources.
     - The goal of a network is to enable data exchange, collaborative use of resources, and facilitate communication between users and devices.
   - **Types of Networks**:
     - **Local Area Network (LAN)**:
       - Covers a small geographic area, like a single building, home, or office.
       - Characterized by high data transfer rates and limited geographic range.
       - Commonly uses Ethernet and Wi-Fi for connectivity.
       - Ideal for resource sharing (e.g., printers, files) among a small group of users.
     - **Wide Area Network (WAN)**:
       - Extends over large geographic areas, often nationwide or international.
       - Interconnects multiple LANs, enabling them to communicate across distances.
       - Uses technologies like leased lines, MPLS, and satellite links.
       - Often managed by large service providers due to complex infrastructure requirements.
     - **Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)**:
       - Serves a city or large campus, providing high-speed data transfer across multiple locations within a metropolitan area.
       - Typically larger than LANs but smaller than WANs.
       - Examples include citywide Wi-Fi networks or university campus networks.
   - **Uses of Networks**:
     - **Data Sharing**:
       - Allows devices to access and share files, databases, and applications.
       - Promotes collaboration and efficient data storage.

     - Operations include `push` (add item), `pop` (remove item), and `peek` (view top item without removing it).
   - **Stack Applications**:
     - Used in function call management, expression evaluation (Infix, Prefix, Postfix), backtracking, and more.
   - **Stack as an Abstract Data Type**:
     - An ADT where the user is only concerned with stack operations, not the implementation details.
   - **Multiple Stacks**:
     - In memory-constrained environments, multiple stacks can be implemented to optimize space.
   - **Recursion**:
     - Uses the call stack to remember past function calls, allowing complex recursive calls to be managed.

### 3. Queues
   - **Introduction to Queue**:
     - A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.
   - **Types of Queues**:
     - **Circular Queue**: The end connects back to the front to form a circular structure, preventing overflow until the queue is fully occupied.
     - **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**: Allows insertion and deletion from both ends.
     - **Priority Queue**: Elements are ordered based on priority, so higher-priority elements are dequeued first.

   - **Introduction to Linked List**:
     - A linear data structure where elements are linked using pointers, allowing dynamic memory allocation.
   - **Types of Linked Lists**:
     - **Singly Linked List**: Nodes contain data and a reference to the next node.
     - **Doubly Linked List**: Nodes contain references to both previous and next nodes.
     - **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first, creating a circular structure.
   - **Linked List Applications**:
     - Useful for dynamic data structures like stacks and queues, graph adjacency lists, and hash table collision handling.

   - **Binary Tree Traversal**:
     - **Inorder (Left, Root, Right)**: Used in binary search trees to get sorted data.
     - **Preorder (Root, Left, Right)**: Useful for creating a copy of the tree.
     - **Postorder (Left, Right, Root)**: Commonly used for deleting a tree.
   - **Threaded Binary Tree**:
     - Binary trees where null pointers are replaced by pointers to the inorder predecessor/successor to optimize traversal.
   - **B-Trees and Height-Balanced Trees**:
     - **B-Tree**: A balanced tree optimized for read/write operations, often used in databases.
     - **B+ Tree**: An extension of B-Tree where all data is stored in leaf nodes, with internal nodes as keys for faster searching.

### 6. Searching and Sorting
   - **Searching Algorithms**:
     - **Sequential Search**: Linear search through each element; suitable for unsorted data.
